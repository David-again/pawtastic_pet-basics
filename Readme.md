# PawTastic!!! A simple pet-tracking site.
### A project I'm working on for a hypothetical pet-grooming agency.

Will begin with the registration page for the user's pet.
Next will be the registration page for the owner.
Finally a MongoDB database to store and link their details.

From there, the project is likely to expand... 

Emphasis will be on a Mobile-first philosophy.

Come back soon! ðŸ˜Ž

<!-- The 'Nav' section of the 'Pet basics' page is 80% completed...
Outstanding:
    Vertical progress bar to the left of page navigators.
    Will be done alongside the JavaScript section. -->
