# PawTastic!!! A simple customer data management site.
### A project I'm working on for a hypothetical pet-grooming agency.

Got the idea from "Daily UI Challenge" screenshots of a hypothetical pet-grooming service.
I am beginning with the registration page for the user's pet; (it is based on the screenshot found in "./images/prototypes/Screenshots/").

Next will be the registration page for the pet's owner.
Finally a MongoDB database to store and link the details of both pet(s) and owner.

From there, the project could possibly expand... 

Emphasis on a Mobile-first philosophy, make it accessible from small devices.

If you're seeing this message, the project is still in development.  Feel free to check out the source code at https://github.com/David-again/pawtastic_pet-basics

Come back soon! ðŸ˜Ž
